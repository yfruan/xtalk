## 🎬 Demo

### Online Demo
[Demo Link](https://xtalk.sjtuxlance.com/)

This demo runs on 4090 cluster with 8-bit quantized *SenseVoice* as speech recognizer, *IndexTTS 1.5* as speech generator, and 4-bit quantized *Qwen3-30B-A3B* as language model. Though at the cost of intelligence due to a relatively small language model, it demonstrates low latency.

The tour guiding demos are conducted with *Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct* as language model, and the other eight demos are aligned with the online demo setting. Larger language models are more intelligent at the cost of latency.

<a id="installation"></a>
## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/xcc-zach/xtalk.git@main
```

<a id="quickstart"></a>
## 🚀 Quickstart

We will use APIs from AliCloud to demonstrate the basic capability of **X-Talk**.

First, install dependencies for AliCloud and server script:
```bash
pip install "xtalk[ali] @ git+https://github.com/xcc-zach/xtalk.git@main"
pip install jinja2 'uvicorn[standard]'
```

Then, obtain an API key from [AliCloud Bailian Platform](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?tab=model#/api-key). We will be using free-tier service from AliCloud.

> Online service may be unstable and of high latency. We recommend using locally deployed models for better user experience. See [server config tutorial](#config-the-server) and [supported models](#supported-models) for details.

After that, create a JSON config specifying the models to use, and **fill in <API_KEY>** with the key you obtained:
<details>
<summary>Basic Config</summary>
    
```json
{
    "asr": {
        "type": "Qwen3ASRFlashRealtime",
        "params": {
            "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
        }
    },
    "llm_agent": {
        "type": "DefaultAgent",
        "params": {
            "model": {
                "api_key": "<API_KEY>",
                "model": "qwen-plus-2025-12-01",
                "base_url": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
            }
        }
    },
    "tts": {
        "type": "CosyVoice",
        "params": {
            "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
        }
    }
}
```
    
</details>

> If you find *Qwen3ASRFlashRealtime* not working properly, you can use `"asr": "SenseVoiceSmallLocal",` instead which is a ~1GB local model.

The next step is to compose the startup script. Since we also need to link frontend webpage and scripts to get the demo working, the startup script is ready at `examples/sample_app/configurable_server.py`. We simply need to start the server with the config file (**fill in <PATH_TO_CONFIG>.json** with the path to the config file we just created) and a custom port:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xcc-zach/xtalk.git
cd xtalk
python examples/sample_app/configurable_server.py  --port 7635 --config <PATH_TO_CONFIG>.json
```

Finally, our demo is ready at `http://localhost:7635`. View it in the browser!

## 📖 Tutorial
    
### Start the Server
    
> [!NOTE]
> See `examples/sample_app/configurable_server.py`, `frontend/src` and `examples/sample_app/templates` for details.
   
X-Talk has most models and execution on server side, and the client is responsible for interacting with microphone, transmitting audio and Websocket messages, and handle lightweight operations like Voice-Actitvty-Detection.
    
For client side, you can start with snippet in `examples/sample_app/templates/index.html` and track where `convo` is used to see how to use frontend API:
```html
<script type="module">
        import { createConversation } from "/static/js/index.js";

        const convo = createConversation();
    ...
</script>
```
    
The client-side API mainly comes from `frontend/src/js/index.js`, and if interested, you can check the core code to see how different Websocket messages are handled:
```javascript
switch (json.action) {
            case 'queue_status': {...}
            case 'queue_granted': {...}
    ...
}    
```

We plan to improve the client-side API in the near future.

For the server side, the core logic is to connect a X-Talk instance to Websocket of FastAPI instance:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from xtalk import Xtalk
app = FastAPI(title="Xtalk Server")
xtalk_instance = Xtalk.from_config("path/to/config.json")
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await xtalk_instance.connect(websocket)
```
    
Then you can check `examples/sample_app/configurable_server.py` for how to mount client-side scripts and pages.
    
#### Text Embedding

> [!NOTE]
> See `examples/sample_app/configurable_server.py` and `frontend/src/js/index.js` for details.
    
X-Talk can understand documents uploaded through embedding search. To enable embedding, you need `langchain_openai.OpenAIEmbeddings` in the config:
```json
"embeddings": {
    "type": "OpenAIEmbeddings",
    "params": {
      "api_key": "<API_KEY>",
      "base_url": "<URL LIKE http://127.0.0.1:8002/v1>",
      "model": "<MODEL LIKE Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B>"
    }
  },
```

Then you can fetch `text` and `session_id` from client side and notify X-Talk instance through `embed_text`:
```python
@app.post("/api/upload")
async def upload_file(
    session_id: str = Form(...),
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
):
    # Check file type
    content_type = (file.content_type or "").lower()
    filename = (file.filename or "").lower()
    is_text = content_type.startswith("text/") if content_type else False
    if content_type and not is_text:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Only text files are supported.")
    # Read file content and embed
    text = (await file.read()).decode("utf-8", errors="ignore")
    await xtalk_instance.embed_text(session_id=session_id, text=text)
    return {"status": "ok"}
```
    
Note that client side should save `session_id` and send it in the request. Search `'session_info'` and `uploadFile` in `frontend/src/js/index.js` for how `session_id` is saved and used.

#### Tool Use
    
> [!NOTE]
> See `examples/sample_app/mental_consultant_server.py` for details.
    
X-Talk supports textual tool customization through `add_agent_tools`:
```python
xtalk_instance.add_agent_tools([build_mental_questionnaire_tool])
```
    
Here tool should be a [Langchain tool](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/tools):
```python
from langchain.tools import tool
def search_database(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> str:
    """Search the customer database for records matching the query.

    Args:
        query: Search terms to look for
        limit: Maximum number of results to return
    """
    return f"Found {limit} results for '{query}'"
```

In order to maintain seperate states for a tool in echo agent, you can also use a tool factory to maintain internal states (see `build_mental_questionnaire_tool` `examples/sample_app/mental_consultant_server.py`)
    
##### Built-in Tools
    
> [!NOTE]
> See source code under `src/xtalk/llm_agent/tools` for all built-in tools.
    
Built-in tools include agent-scope ones like `web_search` and `get_time`, and pipeline control ones like emotion, timbre and speed of speech. `DefaultAgent` has built-in tools registered by default.
    
> [!NOTE]
> In order to enable `web_search` tool, `SERPER_API_KEY` needs to be set. See [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/).

### Config the Server
    
As mentioned [before](#start-the-server), X-Talk instance can be created from a JSON config, which customizes models used and controls concurrency behavior.
    
For model config, config should match model Python class name and init args. For example, the definition of `DefaultAgent` lies in `src/xtalk/llm_agent/default.py`:
```python
class DefaultAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(
            self,
            model: BaseChatModel | dict,
            system_prompt: str = _BASE_PROMPT,
            voice_names: Optional[List[str]] = None,
            emotions: Optional[List[str]] = None,
            tools: Optional[List[Union[BaseTool, Callable[[], BaseTool]]]] = None,
        ):
    ...
```
    
In order to match with the init args, the config item should look like:
```
"llm_agent": {
    "type": "DefaultAgent",
    "params": {
      "model": {
        "api_key": "none",
        "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1",
        "model": "cpatonn/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-AWQ-4bit"
      },
      "voice_names": [
        "Man",
        "Woman",
        "Child"
      ],
      "emotions": [
        "happy",
        "angry",
        "sad",
        "fear",
        "disgust",
        "depressed",
        "surprised",
        "calm",
        "normal"
      ]
    }
  },
```

Optional keys like `voice_names`, `emotions` and `tools`(not supported in config yet) can be ignored.
    
See [below](##Supported-Models) for full list of model types (`slot`), their optional dependencies, and their adapting location in source code.
> [!NOTE]
> Most model implementations are client-side adaptors. You may need to start the model instance following coresponding instructions.
    
Also, you can restrict concurrency through:
```json
    "max_connections": 1
```

### Introduce a New Model
    
> [!NOTE]
> See `examples/sample_app/custom_model.py` and `examples/sample_app/echo_agent.py` for details.
    
> [!NOTE]
> See [Recipe](#recipe) for adding a model of existing types.
    
You may want to introduce a new model of an existing type (e.g. text-to-speech), or add a model of new type (e.g. a model that handles backchannel). This can be achieved by `register_model_search_spec` before a `xtalk_instance` is created from config:
    
```python
from xtalk import Xtalk
Xtalk.register_model_search_spec(
    slot="llm_agent",
    spec=Path(__file__).parent / "echo_agent.py",
)
xtalk_instance = Xtalk.from_config(args.config)
```
    
Here `slot` matches the name of corresponding init arg in `Pipeline`. You can check `Xtalk.MODEL_REGISTRY` for existing slots, or use a new slot to represent a new type of models (see `examples\sample_app\custom_service.py` and there `llm_output_refactor_model` can be the new slot).
    
`spec` is the path to model implementation, an example implementation in `echo_agent.py` looks like this:

```python
from xtalk.model_types import Agent

class EchoAgent(Agent):
    """A simple agent that echoes user input."""

    def generate(self, input) -> str:
        if isinstance(input, dict):
            return input["content"]
        return input

    def clone(self) -> "EchoAgent":
        return EchoAgent()

```
    
Then you can use the custom model in config file:
```python
{
    "asr": {
        "type": "Qwen3ASRFlashRealtime",
        "params": {
            "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
        }
    },
    "llm_agent": "EchoAgent",
    "tts": {
        "type": "CosyVoice",
        "params": {
            "api_key": "<API_KEY>"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Recipe

Recipes for major model customization are listed below. You can read source code for interfaces of other model types. We will update these interfaces from time to time.
    
> [!NOTE]
> See `src/xtalk/model_types.py` for all available model types.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> X-Talk has asynchronous default implementations for sync versions, which usually with `run_in_executor`, like `async_recognize` for `recognize` w.r.t. ASR. However, in order to achieve best concurrency for production, we recommend to implement these async versions by your self.

##### New ASR (auto-speech-recognition) Model
    
Your ASR class must inherit from `xtalk.speech.interfaces.ASR` and implement the following methods:

* **`recognize(audio: bytes) -> str`**
    * Recognize audio in a single pass. 
* **`reset() -> None`**
    * Reset internal recognition state.
* **`clone() -> ASR`**
    * Return a new instance for use in new or concurrent sessions.
    * Sharing weights/connections (e.g., `_shared_model`) is allowed, but you can't share states. 
    
Methods below are optional:
* **`recognize_stream(audio: bytes, *, is_final: bool = False) -> str`**
    * Interface for streaming incremental recognition.
    * Returns the "current cumulative recognition result up to this point".
* **`async_recognize(audio: bytes)`**
* **`async def async_recognize_stream(
        self, audio: bytes, *, is_final: bool = False
    )`**

    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Input for `recognize` and `recognize_stream` is PCM 16-bit mono 16 kHz raw bytes. You may need to do conversion by yourself.
    
> [!NOTE]
> X-Talk have default implementation for `recognize_stream` with a `MockStreamRecognizer`. Therefore, no worry for your non-streaming ASR models.

> [!NOTE]
> You can refer to existing implementations (e.g., `src/xtalk/speech/asr/zipformer_local.py`) when building your own ASR class. We recommend deploying ASR as a separate service and invoking it via API calls within the ASR class, referencing the implementation of `src/xtalk/speech/asr/sherpa_onnx_asr.py`.
    
##### New TTS (text-to-speech) Model
    
Your new TTS class must inherit from `xtalk.speech.interfaces.TTS` and implement the following methods:


- **`synthesize(self, text: str) -> bytes`**

  - Input: The text to synthesize.
  - Output: Raw audio bytes in PCM 16-bit, mono, 48000 Hz.

- **`clone(self) -> TTS`**

  - Return a new TTS instance:
    - It should have isolated runtime state to avoid cross-session interference and it may share read-only resources if your backend supports that.
    
**Optional methods**

- **`synthesize_stream(self, text: str, **kwargs) -> Iterable[bytes]`**
  - If your backend supports streaming synthesis, you can override this method.
- **`set_voice(self, voice_names: list[str])`**

  - This method works with the `TTSVoiceChange` event in `TTSManager` to switch voices via language model tool calls.
  - Usually there is only one element in `voice_names`, and this is the current behavior for tool call result. However, some TTS models may support mixing multiple voices for reference. Therefore, `voice_names` is list type.

- **`set_emotion(self, emotion: str | list[float])`**

  - This method works with the `TTSEmotionChange` event in `TTSManager` to switch emotions via language model tool calls.
  - Current tool call result only carries `emotion` as `str`. However, you may also want `list[float]` as emotion vector for future use.
    
- **`async def async_synthesize(self, text: str, **kwargs: Any)`**
- **`async def async_synthesize_stream(
        self, text: str, **kwargs: Any
    )`**    
    
### Customize the Service

> [!NOTE]
> See `examples/sample_app/custom_service.py` for details. A dummy `LLMOutputRefactorModel` is added to X-Talk to prepend `Assistant response: ` before model response text.
    
If you want to add new functionality, you can follow the procesures below:
    
First, you may want to define a new model. Here is a model that prepend some text before input:
```python
# Define a custom model
class LLMOutputRefactorModel:
    def refactor(self, llm_output: str) -> str:
        # Custom logic to refactor LLM output
        return "Assistant response: " + llm_output

    # If custom model has internal state, implement clone method with concrete state
    def clone(self):
        return LLMOutputRefactorModel()
```
Note that `clone` is neccesary when your model has internal state that should be distinct across user sessions, like the recognition cache of a streaming speech recognition model.
    
If you define a new model, or want to add some new function to `Pipeline`, the second step is to define a custom `Pipeline`:
```python
@dataclass(init=False)
class CustomPipeline(DefaultPipeline):
    llm_output_refactor_model: Optional["LLMOutputRefactorModel"] = field(
        default=None,
        metadata={"init_key": "llm_output_refactor_model", "clone": True},
    )

    def __init__(
        self,
        asr: ASR,
        llm_agent: Agent,
        tts: TTS,
        captioner: Optional[Captioner] = None,
        punt_restorer_model: Optional[PuntRestorer] = None,
        caption_rewriter: Optional[Rewriter | BaseChatModel] = None,
        thought_rewriter: Optional[Rewriter | BaseChatModel] = None,
        vad: Optional[VAD] = None,
        speech_enhancer: Optional[SpeechEnhancer] = None,
        speaker_encoder: Optional[SpeakerEncoder] = None,
        speech_speed_controller: Optional[SpeechSpeedController] = None,
        embeddings: Optional[Embeddings] = None,
        llm_output_refactor_model: Optional["LLMOutputRefactorModel"] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        super().__init__(
            asr=asr,
            llm_agent=llm_agent,
            tts=tts,
            captioner=captioner,
            punt_restorer_model=punt_restorer_model,
            caption_rewriter=caption_rewriter,
            thought_rewriter=thought_rewriter,
            vad=vad,
            speech_enhancer=speech_enhancer,
            speaker_encoder=speaker_encoder,
            speech_speed_controller=speech_speed_controller,
            embeddings=embeddings,
            **kwargs,
        )
        self.llm_output_refactor_model = llm_output_refactor_model

    def get_llm_output_refactor_model(
        self,
    ) -> Optional["LLMOutputRefactorModel"]:
        return self.llm_output_refactor_model
```
Note that `**kwargs` is necessary in `__init__` to swallow shadowed parameters from `DefaultPipeline`. And if you add a new arg to `__init__`, you will need to register it as a `field`, specifying its `clone` behavior (`True/False`)

Based on X-Talk’s event-bus mechanism, then you can add a new `Manager` to subscribe to an existing `Event` and implement the custom functionality you need. Meanwhile, you can create a new `Event` if needed.
    For Example:
```python
LLMOutputRefactoredFinal = create_event_class(
    name="LLMOutputRefactoredFinal", fields={"text": "", "turn_id": 0} # key: default_value
)

class LLMOutputRefactorManager(Manager):
    def __init__(
        self,
        event_bus: EventBus,
        session_id: str,
        pipeline: Pipeline,
        config: dict[str, Any],
    ):
        self.event_bus = event_bus
        self.pipeline = pipeline

    @Manager.event_handler(LLMAgentResponseFinish)
    async def handle_llm_response_finish(self, event: LLMAgentResponseFinish):
        refactor_model = self.pipeline.get_llm_output_refactor_model()
        if refactor_model:
            refactored_output = refactor_model.refactor(event.text)
            new_event = LLMOutputRefactoredFinal(
                session_id=event.session_id,
                text=refactored_output,
                turn_id=event.turn_id,
            )
            await self.event_bus.publish(new_event)

    async def shutdown(self):
        pass
    
custom_service = DefaultService(pipeline=pipeline)
custom_service.register_manager(LLMOutputRefactorManager)
```
    
Then you can optionally use `unsubscribe_event` and `subscribe_event` to switch other components (such as `OutputGateway`) from subscribing the old event to the new event. Meanwhile, for the new event, you need to implement the handling method.

```python
custom_service.unsubscribe_event(
    event_listener_cls=OutputGateway, event_type=LLMAgentResponseFinish
)

async def output_gateway_llm_output_refactored_final_handler(
    self: OutputGateway,
    event,
):
    await self.send_signal(
        {
            "action": "finish_resp", # you can find "finish_resp" in frontend/src/js/index.js
            "data": {"text": event.text, "turn_id": event.turn_id},
        }
    )

custom_service.subscribe_event(
    event_listener_cls=OutputGateway,
    event_type=LLMOutputRefactoredFinal,
    method_or_handler=output_gateway_llm_output_refactored_final_handler,
)
```

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

![XTalk Data Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db52398a-80b1-46e0-9e09-63cf301eed59)
*Prospective Data Flow of X-Talk*

![XTalk Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5187cd7b-ce8d-4273-8c60-6b552e139c3d)
*Architecture of X-Talk*

X-Talk follows a **modular, stage-wise functional flow**, progressing from noisy speech input, through frontend speech interaction, speech understanding, and an LLM-driven conversational agent, to speech generation. This logical pipeline is realized through a **layered, event-driven, and loosely-coupled architecture**, which forms the core of the system.

This design systematically addresses the key challenges of real-time speech-to-speech dialogue systems:

- Controlling **sub-second end-to-end latency**
- Orchestrating **multiple heterogeneous components**
- Enabling **flexible integration and swapping of backend models and services**

The entire system is built around a **centralized event bus**. All layers communicate asynchronously through event publishing and subscribing, enabling efficient management of complex conversational state and data flow.


### Frontend Layer

The Frontend Layer serves as the user-facing interface and directly handles browser-based interaction. It is responsible for:

- Rendering the conversational user interface  
- Performing client-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD)  
- Applying audio denoising and enhancement  
- Displaying real-time latency metrics to the user  

This layer packages audio streams, VAD markers, and contextual information for transmission to the backend.


### Event Center Layer

The Event Center Layer acts as the system’s **communication hub and network boundary**, unifying event routing and protocol translation. It consists of two tightly integrated components:

- **Gateways**  
  - The *Input Gateway* converts frontend streams into typed internal events  
  - The *Output Gateway* delivers processed events back to the frontend  

- **Event Bus**  
  - Provides the asynchronous messaging fabric  
  - Routes events between all components in the system  

Together, these components decouple all other layers by handling protocol adaptation, event distribution, and lifecycle isolation, forming the **extensible backbone** of the architecture.


### Managers Layer

The Managers Layer orchestrates the core conversational workflow through **specialized, capability-specific managers**. Each manager:

- Subscribes to relevant events  
- Executes its dedicated logic (e.g., ASR, LLM inference, TTS)  
- Publishes new events to drive the dialogue forward  

This event-driven orchestration enables fine-grained control over execution order, concurrency, and latency.


### Agents Layer

The Agents Layer functions as the system’s **task-planning and execution engine**. It integrates structured inputs from upstream models—such as ASR outputs, voice captions, and contextual signals—into a coherent speech understanding.

Based on this understanding, the agent orchestrates tool usage, including:

- Web search  
- Local retrieval  
- Audio control  
- External API calls  

Finally, it synthesizes retrieved or processed information into a **context-aware natural language response**.


### Models Layer

The Models Layer provides a **unified, interface-driven abstraction** for core speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities, including:

- Speech understanding  
- LLM-based conversational agents  
- Speech generation  

By defining stable and modular contracts for each capability, this layer allows compliant implementations to be seamlessly integrated, swapped, or scaled without impacting other system components.
